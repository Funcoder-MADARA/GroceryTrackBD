Temporary Change Log - User Registration Status (auto-approve)
===============================================================

Date: [Fill in today's date]
Author: [Your Name]

Summary:
--------
Temporarily modified the user registration logic so that all new user accounts are automatically set to 'active' status, bypassing the manual admin approval process. This is for development/testing purposes and should be reverted for production or when manual approval is required again.

Files Modified:
---------------
- GroceryTrackBD/routes/auth.js

Details of Change:
------------------
- In the POST /register route, the following code block was COMMENTED OUT:

    // For regular users, default to inactive until approved
    status: 'inactive'

- Instead, the following was ADDED (temporary):

    // TEMP: Automatically set to active for all new users
    status: 'active'

- The original code is preserved in comments for easy reversion.

How to Revert:
--------------
1. Open GroceryTrackBD/routes/auth.js
2. Find the section marked with:
   // TEMPORARY CHANGE: Automatically approve all new users by setting status to 'active'.
3. Uncomment the original userData block that sets status: 'inactive'.
4. Remove or comment out the temporary userData block that sets status: 'active'.
5. Save the file.

Why:
----
- This change allows all new user registrations to be immediately active, bypassing the admin approval step.
- Useful for development, testing, or demo purposes.
- Should be reverted before deploying to production or when you want to require admin approval for new users again.
